Django Activity Stream
=======================

This is a reusable Django application with which you can log activities your users are making
and displaying a stream similar to the activity stream in facebook.

Users can choose to Follow other Users activity Streams.

Activity Items can have a safetylevel...so you can decide if they are public or just for friends.

Activity Items can be commented and "liked". If you like an activity item of another user,
all your followers will see it too.


To define different Types of Activities:
ActivityTypes.objects.create(name="started_following", batch_time_minutes=30, is_batchable=True)


To create an activity (when the user does something):
from activity_stream.models import create_activity_item
create_activity_item(type, user, subject, data=None, safetylevel=1)


Integration into existing Networks:
If you have preexisting networks like Friends, Contacts etc. you can define two functions in your settings file
that the activity app will use to find the people you follow when your stream is rendered.

ACTIVITY_GET_PEOPLE_I_FOLLOW = lambda user: get_people_i_follow(user)
ACTIVITY_GET_MY_FOLLOWERS = lambda user: get_my_followers(user)


Templates for Rendering:
The app looks for the templates to render the stream in the following folder:
templates/activity_stream/<activity_type>/full.html
templates/activity_stream/<activity_type>/full_batched.html


What is Batching?
Some actions happen a lot, eg.: placing images on a map (thats my case). So instead of displaying an activity item
each and every time these actions can be batched by using:

is_batchable=True

furthermore you can set the batch time:

batch_time_minutes=30

so if repeat an action within 30 Minutes they will be one activity item with 2 Subjects, instead of 2 Activities with
one Subject each.

================================================================
This is still the Alpha version...improvements coming soon.
